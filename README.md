## Dataset

> This data set contains approximately 175,000 rows of individual trip data from January 2018 to December 2018 covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Each row represents a bike ride and contains 15 original features such as the start and end time of the trip, the name, number and location of the start and end of the trip, the customer's membership type, year of birth and gender. The data also includes information on whether or not a bike was shared on all trips. This dataset provides valuable insights into how people use bike-sharing systems in San Francisco Bay Area.


## Summary of Findings

>  The distributions of the variables of interest showed that most trips occur during the working hours of 6am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm, with Thursday having the highest number of trips. The median trip duration was 9 minutes, with most trips lasting between 5 and 12 minutes, and the median trip distance was 1.4 km, with most trips ranging between 0.89 km and 2.1 km. It was observed that the duration of bike rides tends to be longer on weekends than on weekdays, and there is a slight difference in the duration of bike rides according to age category, with older adults having the longest riding time by 1 minute more than young and middle adults. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the duration of the trip and the age category, as longer trips were more likely to be taken by young adults rather than older adults.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- The distribution of trips over hours.
- The distribution of trip distance among all trips.
- How the duration of riding a bike differs on different week days.
